<h2>Building a startup in a zenlike state of not wanting anything</h2>
<p>
 I created a couple of startups in my life. Some were successful, some
 flopped. Financially, it turned out well. I am now in a position to do
 whatever I like. At least for a while. But the times I had building these
 companies were only mediocre. It was stressful every time. I never felt like
 "This is it. I am in heaven.".
</p><p>
 People always told me that I am extremely focused and driven. Some expressed
 it in a positive way "Always full of energy" and some in a negative way
 "There is always so much tension in your company".
</p><p>
 During the last 2 years, I got meditation a lot. I meditate about an
 hour a day. And it's the best time I have. When I meditate, I feel like
 "This is it.". Maybe for the first time ever.
</p><p>
 I wonder if it is possible to bring this state of mind into the rest of
 the day. If it is possible to be completely in the here and now without
 any desire all day long.
</p><p>
 So with my new startup, this time I am trying something different. Staying
 in a zenlike state of "hereness" all day long. When I eat, I eat. When walk,
 I walk. When I notice thoughts, I let them do their thing. Stay or leave.
 I will not try to "think through" anything. Or try to think of something
 more important. Or push myself to do more important things first. I will
 just watch my hands working. Whatever they do, they do.
</p><p>
 This blog post (or whatever it is) is an example of this. It struck me while
 showering this morning. To write it down. Normally, I would have thought
 "Ok, how can this help my business? How can I make it popular?". This time,
 I just let it flow. Let my hands to the typing, if they like.
</p><p>
 Then I needed a place to host it. Normally, I would have taken a long look
 at all the different blog hosting options and compared them.
</p><p>
 This time, I did none of these. For some reason the idea struck me to
 read Hacker News from top to bottom and use the first site that is linked
 from there that offers to host text. It turned out to be GitHub. Is GitHub
 a good choice? I don't know. I don't think about it. I just let my
 fingers do what they do.
</p><p>
 Can this work? Startup's are usually associated with a driven, focused
 founder with a vision. This time, I'm a founder who does what ever bubbles
 up from his unconscious at any given time. Without thinking about it.
</p><p>
 Let's see how this turns out.
