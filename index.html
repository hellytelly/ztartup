<h2>Building a startup in a zenlike state of wanting nothing</h2>
<p>
 I created a couple of startups in my life. Some were successful, some
 flopped. Financially, it turned out well. I am now in a position to do
 whatever I like. At least for a while. But the times I had building these
 companies were only mediocre. It was stressful everytime. I never felt like
 "This is it. I am in heaven.".
</p><p>
 During the last 2 years, I got meditation a lot. I meditate about an
 hour a day. And it's the best time I have. When I meditate, I feel like
 "This is it.". Maybe even for the first time ever.
</p><p>
 I wonder if it is possible to bring this state of mind into the rest of
 the day. If it is possible to be completely in the here and now without
 any desire all day long.
</p><p>
 So with my new startup, this time I am trying something different. Staying
 in a zenlike state of "hereness" all day long. When I eat, I eat. When walk,
 I walk. When I notice thoughts, I let them do their thing. Stay or leave.
 I will not try to "think through" anything. Or try to think of something
 more important. Or push myself to do more important things first. I will
 just watch my hands working. Whatever they do, they do.
